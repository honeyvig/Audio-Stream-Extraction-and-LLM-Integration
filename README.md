# Audio-Stream-Extraction-and-LLM-Integration
specializing in the extraction and integration of audio streams with large language models (LLMs). The perfect candidate will possess a robust background in audio processing, along with hands-on experience in leveraging LLMs to facilitate smooth audio manipulation and analysis.

In this role, you will be tasked with developing innovative solutions to manage real-time audio streams across diverse applications. If you have a deep enthusiasm for the intersection of audio technology and artificial intelligence
==========
Hereâ€™s an outline of Python code for a project focusing on integrating audio streams with Large Language Models (LLMs). This framework allows for real-time audio processing, transcription, and analysis using audio processing libraries and AI models like OpenAI's Whisper and GPT.
Key Features

    Audio Stream Capture: Captures real-time audio from microphones or other sources.
    Audio-to-Text Transcription: Uses Whisper for accurate transcription.
    LLM Integration: Processes transcribed text with GPT for analysis or conversational AI.

Features of the Code

    Audio Streaming:
        Uses pyaudio to capture audio in real-time.
        Saves the recorded audio as a .wav file.

    Whisper for Transcription:
        Leverages OpenAI's Whisper model for high-accuracy transcription of audio files.

    Integration with GPT:
        Sends transcribed text to OpenAI's GPT API for further processing.

    Real-Time Execution:
        Supports a real-time processing pipeline by threading the tasks.

Requirements

    Dependencies: Install the following Python packages:

    pip install pyaudio whisper openai

    OpenAI API Key: Replace your_openai_api_key with your actual API key from OpenAI.

    Microphone Permissions: Ensure your system grants microphone access to the script.

Applications

    Sentiment Analysis: Derive emotional tone from the audio transcription.
    Speech-to-Command Systems: Use audio inputs to trigger predefined actions.
    Real-Time Transcription Services: Ideal for meetings or events.

Feel free to expand the script based on your specific use case!
